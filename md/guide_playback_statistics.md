# Playback Statistics

> Note: This is a topic for intermediate/advanced users with a good understanding of how `JScript Panel 3`
> works with relation to `handles` and `handle lists` and you're familiar with
> `callbacks`.
> It uses the same mechanism for data storage as foo_playcount,
> and data is remembered for up to 4 weeks when no matching track is part of the `Media Library` or any playlist.
> Unlike previous implementaions in other scripting components, this allows you to customise the
> title formatting that database records are bound to.
> The default is `$lower($meta(artist,0) - %title%)` but it can be changed via
> `File>Preferences>Advanced>Tools>JScript Panel 3>Playback Statistics Title Format`.
> Note that changing this requires an immediate `foobar2000` restart and any previously
> saved data is lost forever. Be careful!
> Remember that if you think of using `%path%`, you must also include `%subsong%`. One
> physical file can have the same path for multiple handles if it's a cuesheet or
> other type of track with multiple chapters.

## Overview

First of all, there are 6 fields available through title formatting in any component and search.

```
%jsp3_playcount%
%jsp3_loved%
%jsp3_first_played%
%jsp3_last_played%
%jsp3_rating%
%jsp3_skipcount% // added in component version 3.3.14
```

To write these values, 6 `handle` methods can be used.

```
var handle = fb.GetFocusItem();
if (handle) {
    // Must be a whole number, use 0 to clear.
    handle.SetPlayCount(12);
    // Must be a whole number, use 0 to clear.
    handle.SetLoved(1);
    // Must be a whole number, use 0 to clear.
    handle.SetFirstPlayed(unix_timestamp);
    // Must be a whole number, use 0 to clear.
    handle.SetLastPlayed(unix_timestamp);
    // Must be a whole number, use 0 to clear.
    // Obviously there are no restrictions on the maximum value
    handle.SetRating(5);
    // Added in 3.3.14. Must be a whole number, use 0 to clear.
    handle.SetSkipcount(skipcount);
}
```

Although first played and last played are written/stored as unix timestamps, they are retrieved as
strings in the usual foobar2000 `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format,
adjusted to your local time zone.

Helper methods already exist for converting between them.

utils.DateStringToTimestamp(str)

utils.TimestampToDateString(ts)

To get the current time as a unix timestamp, you can use this:

```
var now = utils.Now();
```

After updating value(s) for a `handle`, you must use `RefreshStats` so the foobar2000 core
and all other components are made aware of the changes. There is a `IMetadbHandleList` `RefreshStats()` method for this.

```
var handle = fb.GetFocusItem();
handle.SetRating(5);

// creating a handle list from a single handle can be done like this...
var handles = fb.CreateHandleList(handle);
handles.RefreshStats();
```

Finally there is also `IMetadbHandleList` `ClearStats()` which should be self explanatory.
This method calls `RefreshStats()` internally so there is no need to call it after.

## Example

Here's a crude example that updates as you play using the same rules as Last.fm
for the amount of time you have to play a track. Of course it can be modified in any way you like.

```
var time_elapsed = 0;
var target_time = 0;

var tf_fp = fb.TitleFormat("%jsp3_first_played%");

// if a track hasn't been played yet, we want zero
// so it can be easily incremented
var tf_pc = fb.TitleFormat("$if2(%jsp3_playcount%,0)");

function on_playback_new_track() {
    // reset
    time_elapsed = 0;

    // this example uses the same rule as last.fm
    // half the track length or 4 minutes - whichever is lower
    target_time = Math.min(Math.ceil(fb.PlaybackLength / 2), 240);
}

function on_playback_time() {
    time_elapsed++;
    if (time_elapsed == target_time) {
        var now = Math.round(new Date().getTime() / 1000);
        var handle = fb.GetNowPlaying();

        // the return value from title format functions is always a string
        // but we want a number
        var playcount = Number(tf_pc.Eval());

        // increment playcount by 1
        handle.SetPlaycount(playcount + 1)

        // only write first played if it's currently empty
        if (tf_fp.Eval() == "") {
            handle.SetFirstPlayed(now);
        }

        // always write last played
        handle.SetLastPlayed(now)

        // notify foobar2000 core / other components
        fb.CreateHandleList(handle).RefreshStats();
    }
}
```
