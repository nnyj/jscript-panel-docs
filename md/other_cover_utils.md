# Cover Utils

Download

> Note: This component requires at least `Windows 8.1+` and `foobar2000` `2.1+`.

> Important: This is a combined replacement for `foo_cover_info` and
> `foo_cover_resizer`. If you have either/both installed,
> you must remove them first.
> Note that this uses a separate database for front cover info
> storage so files would need scanning again. Also, different title
> format fields are used for display. See below.

## Usage

Use the right click menu on any playlist/library selection and you'll find
a `Cover Utils` sub menu.

#### Resize

This option will resize existing embedded art. Reading most common image
types is supported but you must choose `JPG` or `WebP` when saving.

#### Convert without resizing

Converts existing embedded art without resizing. You must choose
`JPG` or `WebP`.

#### Browse for file, resize and attach

This option lets you browse for an image file and will then resize it
before attaching it to the current selection. Images already smaller than
the specified max size will not be processed. You should attach those
via the native foobar2000 options under the
`Tagging` menu.

#### Browse for file, convert and attach

Use the file picker and then choose to convert the file to `JPG` or `WebP`.

#### Remove all except front

Since most people only want front covers, this is a handy method for
removing all the other types.

#### Scan for info

Because it's not possible to query files for embedded album art within
foobar2000, you can use this option
to process a selection of files and store the results in a database.

Updating of data is not automatic so if you add/remove art at a later
date, it's up to you to run the scan again.

Data is available in the following fields which are available wherever
title formatting is supported.

| Field |  |
| --- | --- |
| %cover_utils_front_width% |  |
| %cover_utils_front_height% |  |
| %cover_utils_front_format% | JPEG, PNG, WebP, etc. |
| %cover_utils_front_size% | Nicely formatted image size in KB/MB. |
| %cover_utils_front_bytes% | Raw image size. |

> Note: Database records are attached to the `%path%` of each file. Records
> are preserved if files are renamed/moved with File operations.
> If files are renamed/moved externally, records would be orphaned and the files would need
> scanning again.
> Records have a lifetime of 4 weeks if they are
> not included in the `Media Library` or playlist.

> Example: Here's a custom column configuration that would show all information
> if present.
> ```
> [%cover_utils_front_width%x%cover_utils_front_height%, %cover_utils_front_size%, %cover_utils_front_format%]
> ```
> You can also perform playlist/library searches using query syntax like this:
> ```
> %cover_utils_front_width% PRESENT
> ```

#### Clear cover info

This clears all existing info for the current selection.
