`IsValid` will always be `false` if foobar2000 isn't playing. It can
also be `false` if the playing track has since been removed from the playlist it was on when playback was started.

> Example: ```
> var playing_item_location = plman.GetPlayingItemLocation();
> if (playing_item_location.IsValid) {
>     console.log(playing_item_location.PlaylistIndex);
>     console.log(playing_item_location.PlaylistItemIndex);
> }
> ```
