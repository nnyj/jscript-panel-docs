- The zoom can be reset using Ctrl+0.

- `Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons + Volume` is a modification of an existing script adding a `Volume` slider.

## 3.2.16

The `Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons` have been updated to provide an alternative button set if the `Segoe Fluent Icons` font is installed. `Windows 11`
users have it by default, `Windows 10` users can download it here.

reload the script and take advantage of it.

The new set is only available on `Windows 10` or later because it uses the `Segoe MDL2 Assets` font. The option will be greyed out on earlier versions of `Windows`. Use the right click menu to choose:
