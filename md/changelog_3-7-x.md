# 3.7.x

> Note: Component version `3.5.0` and later require at least `foobar2000` `2.1` and `Windows 10`.

## 3.7.9

- Fix an ugly timer related crash. Apologies to anyone affected by this.
- `Smooth Playlist Manager` and the playlist manager built in to `JS Playlist` now show a distinction between autoplaylists and playlists that are locked. Previously, they shared the same icon.

## 3.7.8

- Fix `Last.fm` web request bugs after changing the api key. The bug would have fixed itself after restarting `foobar2000` but that shouldn't have been necessary.

## 3.7.7

- This is just a further refinement of the bug fix in `3.7.6`.

## 3.7.6

- Fix deadlock when using `Columns UI` to switch themes containing `JScript Panel 3` instances.

## 3.7.5

- Update utils.DownloadFileAsync with new `verify_image` argument.
- Update `Thumbs` and `Images` samples to use the above method as it has been noticed that `Last.fm` can serve files which are not images.

## 3.7.4

- Update various samples with image display improvements.
- Various bug fixes.

## 3.7.3

- Users of `Last.fm Bio`, `Last.fm Bio + Images` and `Last.fm Artist Info + User Info` now need to set their own Last.fm API key via the right click menu. You can get one from this link: https://www.last.fm/api/account/create

## 3.7.2

- Fix `Properties` and `Properties + Other Info` throwing script errors on empty playlists. This was a regression in `3.7.0`.
- Various other sample fixes.

## 3.7.1

- This update exposes all `Album Art` options in the various `Text Display` samples. And once again, they need reloading from the `Samples` button.

## 3.7.0

- There has been a large rewrite of some included samples which means existing users will need to reload these from the `Samples` button: ``` Allmusic + Album Art Allmusic Console Last.fm Artist Info + User Info Last.fm Bio Last.fm Bio + Images MusicBrainz Play Log Properties Properties + Other Info Text Reader ``` Apologies for the inconvenience.
- Add IMetadHandle ShowPictureViewer2.
- With the addition of the above method, the `Album Art` sample picture viewer now works in `Custom` mode.
- A simplified script named `Images` has been added for displaying multiple images without thumbnails. If you use `Thumbs` with thumbnails turned off, it's recommended that you switch to this. It has no limitations on the the size/number of images in a given folder because it only loads one image in memory at a time. Like `Thumbs`, it has custom folder and `Last.fm` support. Scroll with your mouse or use the `Cycle` timer on the right click menu.
