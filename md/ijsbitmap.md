# IJSBitmap

3.8.4

> Note: The original `IJSImage` is perfectly fine for most normal usage except when refreshing the panel
> numerous times per second. A `IJSImage` instance is a wrapper around `IWICBitmap` from the `Windows SDK`
> and this has to be converted to an `ID2D1Bitmap` for rendering. Doing this repeatedly is ineffecient so this
> simplified interface creates an `ID2D1Bitmap` once and reuses it.
> See IJSImage CreateBitmap and utils.LoadBitmap.
