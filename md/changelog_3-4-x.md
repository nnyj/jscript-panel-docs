# 3.4.x

## 3.4.34

- Restore `utils.LoadSVG` after discovering it could be made to work with `Windows 7/8.1`.

## 3.4.33

- Remove `utils.LoadSVG` because it blocked the component from loading on `Windows 7/8.1`. Apologies for not noticing this sooner.

## 3.4.32

- Fix crash bug introduced in `3.4.31`. While applying the latest fixes, code that required `foobar2000` `2.0` was accidentally included.

## 3.4.31

- Restore support for `Windows 7/8`. `Windows 7/8` users upgrading from `3.3.x` or earlier may need to use the `Samples` button to update if they encounter script errors. This font is also required: Segoe Fluent Icons.
- For `Windows 7` compatibility, utils.RemoveFolderRecursive had to be removed.

## 3.4.30

- Fix bug when using `window.Reload()` from inside the `on_mouse_rbtn_up` callback.
- Fix issue introduced in `3.4.20` where main menu items created as keyboard shortcuts only (never displayed) were not executed by `fb.RunMainMenuCommand`.
- Fix `Smooth Playlist Manager` bug where it didn't auto scroll to the active playlist on startup.

## 3.4.29

- The following `plman` methods used to return a `boolean` value to indicate success but they have now been updated to not return any value. ``` plman.ExecutePlaylistDefaultAction plman.MovePlaylist plman.MovePlaylistSelection plman.MovePlaylistSelectionV2 plman.RemovePlaylist plman.RemovePlaylists plman.RemovePlaylistSwitch plman.ReplacePlaylistItem plman.ShowAutoPlaylistUI plman.ShowPlaylistLockUI plman.SortByFormat plman.SortByFormatV2 ``` Most already have `playlistIndex` checks in place to throw script errors if they are invalid. The correct thing to do in most instances is to check playlist lock status before attempting any action. There are functions in helpers.txt to assist with this.

## 3.4.28

- Add `fb.VersionString` property. Provides the same string as `%_foobar2000_version%` but has `[x86]` or `[x64]` appended if using foobar2000 `2.0` or later.
- The `Status Bar` sample has been updated to display the above version string when playback is stopped. Existing users will need to re-import using the `Samples` button.
- Update `JS Playlist` / `Smooth Playlist` so the focus item is indicated when nothing is selected.

## 3.4.27

- Improve `Smooth Browser` multi-select with Shift key support.
- Various other `Smooth` fixes.

## 3.4.21

## 3.4.20

- `Smooth Browser` and `Smooth Playlist` have been updated with menu items for clearing the `Album Art` cache. Use this if it's displaying stale images after updating `Album Art`.
- `fb.RunMainMenuCommand`, `fb.RunContextCommand` and `IMetadbHandleList` `RunContextCommand` have been fixed so they no longer return `true` on disabled menu items.

## 3.4.19

- `Smooth Browser` has been updated so `Albums` are now sorted in alphabetical order and tracks without `%album%` tags are shunted to the end of the list. They are grouped by `%directory%`.

## 3.4.18

- Add IMetadbHandleList AttachImage2. This method allows attaching images from memory rather than file path.
- Update `Smooth Browser` group settings so the full `%date%` is displayed in `Album` mode.

## 3.4.17

## 3.4.16

- Update `Scintilla` library used for code highlighting. The last release may have had a bug related to undo/redo.
- `JS Playlist` and `Smooth Playlist` have been updated so you can right click in a blank area and `Paste` clipboard items. Previously, you had to select a valid playlist item and it was impossible to `Paste` in an empty playlist.
- Update `Smooth Playlist` context menu so the settings are always shown no matter where you right click.
- Various other playlist fixes.

## 3.4.15

- Minor component bug fixes.
- Fix bugs with `Minimal Seekbar` and `Text Display + Album Art + Seekbar + Buttons` samples where the seekbars were not centred and playback time was not displayed when listening to streams. Existing users will need to re-import using the `Samples` button.
- Fix bugs with the `basic\WriteTextStyles` and `basic\SimpleScroll + Styled Text` samples. The corresponding documentation has also been fixed.

## 3.4.14

- Fix bug with `Minimal Seekbar` where the seekbar knob overlapped the length text at the end of a track. Existing users will need to re-import using the `Samples` button.

## 3.4.12

- Add IMetadbHandleList Reverse.
- Add `Playback Order` button to the following scripts. The original `Playback Buttons` has been left untouched. ``` Playback Buttons + Playback Order Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons + Volume Track Info + Spectrogram Seekbar + Buttons ``` Existing users will need to re-import using the `Samples` button. If it's not immediately obvious which mode each icon represents, tooltips give the full name.

## 3.4.11

- Fix bad change to `helpers.txt` in `3.4.8` which caused 3rd party scripts to break. Apologies for the inconvenience.

## 3.4.10

- Various internal improvements.
- `JS Playlist` / `Smooth` sample optimisations.

## 3.4.9

- Update `window.GetFontCUI` to gracefully handle a font with zero size being defined in the `Preferences`.

## 3.4.8

- Internal font handling changes which may help debugging in future.

## 3.4.7

- `FontAwesome` is no longer required. `Segoe Fluent Icons` is now used across all included samples. `Windows 11` users will already have this installed. Everyone else can get it here.
- For existing users of any included button scripts, the following will need re-importing from the `Samples` button: ``` Playback Buttons Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons + Volume Track Info + Spectrogram Seekbar + Buttons ```

## 3.4.6

- Transparency is now reserved exclusively for genuine `Columns UI` toolbars. Adding as a `Toolbar` via the `Columns UI` `Layout` settings will have no effect and it will be a normal panel with a solid colour background. Reverted in `3.4.10`.
- Add new `Minimal Seekbar`. It's just a seekbar with playback time/length and no buttons. It's `Dark Mode` aware and will update itself when toggled.

- Minor sample fixes.

## 3.4.3

- Add utils.Now.

## 3.4.2

- Fix Configuration Window editor regression in `3.4.1`.

## 3.4.1

- Remove the `want_stub` argument from `IMetadbHandle` `GetAlbumArtAsync`. It was marked as deprecated in `3.3.10` and was meant to be removed in `3.4.0` but I forgot. See fb.GetAlbumArtStub.

## 3.4.0

- `window.IsThemed`, `window.CreateThemeManager` and the `IThemeManager` interface have all been removed.
- `IJSGraphics` `FillGradientRectangle` and `FillGradientRectangleAdvanced` have been removed. The standard `FillRectangle` and all other Draw/Fill methods now support gradients.
- The `Edge Style` option has been removed for `Columns UI` panels.
- Existing `Text Display` users will need to re-import using the `Samples` button in the Configuration Window. It now supports `%jsp3_playlist_name%` for displaying the playing/active playlist depending on selection settings. Note the playing track doesn't have to belong to a playlist so use of `$if` or `[]` is recommended.
- When in `text only` mode, the margin can be configured from the right click menu. Also, the default value is reduced.
- The Gallery page has been updated with more notes on exclusive title formatting features only available in this component.
