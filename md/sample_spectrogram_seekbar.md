# Spectrogram Seekbar

This script requires `ffmpeg` to decode the audio track and generate the
image which is cached and used as the background for the seekbar.

For obvious reasons, only local files with a known length are supported.

## Setup

You can download ffmpeg from here.

https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

For best results `ffmpeg` `6.0` or later should be used.

By default, the script will look for it inside your foobar2000 profile
folder. If you wish to change this, edit the script where there is a note next to it.

See here for available `ffmpeg` options which can be set via the right click menu.

Do not set `legend` as that is already disabled.
