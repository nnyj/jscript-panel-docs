# 3.5.x

> Note: Component version `3.5.0` and later require at least `foobar2000` `2.1` and `Windows 10`.

## 3.5.7

- Fix `Last.fm Bio + Images` script error when there are no images to display. It was a regression in `3.5.6`.
- Update `Thumbs` sample so the brightness of the blurred background can be changed. Hold Shift and scroll your mouse wheel to adjust.

## 3.5.6

- `%fb2k_profile_path%` was previously exclusive to the Preprocessor section but now it's available in all ITitleFormat methods. Included samples like `Thumbs` and `Text Reader` can make use of it.
- `Thumbs` has been updated to blur the current image in the background if the `Centre` option has been selected.
- The above change to `Thumbs` means existing users of `Last.fm Bio + Images` must update using the `Samples` button in the Configuration Window.

## 3.5.5

- Update ITitleFormat EvalPlaylistItem and ITitleFormat EvalActivePlaylistItem to return an empty string if supplied with invalid playlist/item indexes. Previously they would return `NEIN` which is a quirk of the `foobar2000` `SDK`.

## 3.5.4

- Add `fb.CustomVolume` for compatibility with `UPnP` output devices. See the note here.
- Update `fb.Volume` to suppress errors if a `UPnP` device is active.
- Update the following samples with `$rgb` support: ``` Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons + Volume Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons Track Info + Spectrogram Seekbar + Buttons ``` Existing users will need to re-import using the `Samples` button in the Configuration Window.
- Reduce height of `utils.TextBox` (used by `Text Display`) so it works on a `1080p` display at `150%` `DPI`.

## 3.5.3

- Fix bug when using `window.Reload()` from inside the `on_mouse_rbtn_up` callback.

## 3.5.2

- Fix issue introduced in `3.4.20` where main menu items created as keyboard shortcuts only (never displayed) were not executed by `fb.RunMainMenuCommand`.
- Fix `Smooth Playlist Manager` bug where it didn't auto scroll to the active playlist on startup.

## 3.5.1

- Add fb.IsLibraryInitialised.
- Add on_library_initialised callback.

## 3.5.0

- The new minimum requirement for `foobar2000` is now `2.1`. `Windows 10` or later is also required.
- `fb.IsV2` has been removed. As it was a property, script errors will not be thrown if used but it will always be `undefined`.
- The IMetadbHandle GetFileInfo method no longer accepts a `full_info` parameter. It was previously required for `foobar2000` `1.x` users but full info is always returned in `foobar2000` `2.x`.
- Update `Spectrogram Seekbar` samples to skip certain file types which `ffmpeg` tries to process but uses excessive amounts of memory leading to possible crashes.
- Fix `JS Playlist` drag/drop bug.
