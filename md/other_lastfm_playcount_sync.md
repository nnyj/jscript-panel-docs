# Last.fm Playcount Sync

Download

## Overview

This component fetches Last.fm playcounts and first played/last played dates
as you listen. A database is used to store the data so your files are not
touched. This does not scrobble so you'll need another component for
that. It's recommended that you use foo_scrobble.

Additionally, you can also love/unlove tracks.

> Note: Although this shares the same name with a previously released version for
> foobar2000 `1.4+`, previous settings/data will
> not be preserved if upgrading. Also there is no support for artist title
> formatting.

> Note: All lookups / storage are based on `$lower($meta(artist,0) - %title%)` with
> no consideration for album tags. This generally means the numbers will match
> anything you see on Last.fm track pages/charts but you won't get the
> album stats you get from diving deeper in to your Last.fm `Library`.

## Usage

Open `File>Preferences>Tools>Last.fm Playcount Sync` and enter your Last.fm username.

### Authorisation

> Note: Using default Last.fm privacy settings, you don't need to
> authorise your account for fetching playcount data.
> If you prefer, you can update your privacy settings to
> `Hide recent listening information`. This requires
> authorisation.
> You also need to authorise your account if you want to love
> or unlove tracks.

To start, click the `Authorise` button. This will launch a browser window
opening the Last.fm website and you must grant
permission for this application BEFORE clicking the confirmation
dialog that opened at the same time as your browser.

When `Authorisation` is complete, you should receive final confirmation. If
you revoke permission or change your password on Last.fm,
you'll need to use the `Clear session` button and `Authorise` again.

### Updating playcounts

Simply listen and it will update in real time. A lookup is performed a
few seconds after playback starts and assuming the server response is
valid, all existing values for that track will be overwritten
by Last.fm data. Server values always take precedence!

When you've listened to enough of a track for a count to scrobble, the
playcount is incremented by one and the last played date is set. This is
the only time data is written without contacting Last.fm
because most scrobblers won't submit until after the track has finished.

If you can't wait to listen your tracks normally, you can batch import
up to 100 tracks at a time... just like this.

You can configure custom playlist colums or anything else that supports
title formatting to display the following:

| Field |  |
| --- | --- |
| %lfm_playcount% |  |
| %lfm_first_played% | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS |
| %lfm_last_played% | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS |

### Loving / unloving tracks

You can `Love` or `Unlove` by right clicking a track (or selection up to 20 tracks)
and using the appropriate menu item. You may consider binding buttons
or keyboard shortcuts.

Note that values are only updated on a successful response from Last.fm.

| Field |  |
| --- | --- |
| %lfm_loved% | Set to 1 if a track is loved. The field will be missing if not. |

### Importing loved tracks

Use the main menu `Library>Last.fm Playcount Sync>Import Last.fm loved tracks`.
Matches will be made against tracks that are monitored as part of the
`Media Library`. Check the `Console` for full results.

### Importing / exporting data

From the main menu `Library>Last.fm Playcount Sync`, you can import/export as
`JSON` for easy transfer to another install or just for backup purposes.

### Errors

Any `Authorisation` errors are reported by popup dialogs. Any errors
updating playcounts, importing loved tracks or loving/unloving tracks
are reported in the `Console`.
