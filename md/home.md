# Overview

This component for foobar2000 is based on WSH Panel Mod.

It allows the creation of customisable panels that can be written with
`JavaScript` rather than the `C++` required by the foobar2000 SDK.

Under the hood, it uses `Windows Script Host`. Because of this, JS language
support is limited to `ECMAScript 5`. Nothing newer will ever be supported.

Here are just some of the features provided by the component...

- Custom drawing of text, external images, lines, rectangles, etc.
- Use fonts/colours from the main preferences of whichever user interface you are using.
- Executing main/context menu commands.
- Ability to create custom buttons/menus.
- Capture keystrokes/mouse movement/clicks.
- Callbacks can be used to trigger code based on various `foobar2000`, `Windows` and `Component` events.
- Read/write file tags.
- Complete manipulation of playlists.
- Media Library display/sorting/filtering
- Save settings on a per panel basis. These persist between restarts and are stored inside the layout configuration file for whichever UI your are using. You can also write your own functions to load/save settings from `JSON` or plain text files.
- Built in support for making `GET / POST` requests which return plain text and there is also a method for downloading binary files. If you prefer, you can use the `Microsoft.XMLHTTP` `ActiveX` object.
- There are many built in methods for working with the local filesystem, launching external applications etc. Previous versions / other scripting components rely on `ActiveX` objects but the need for those is greatly reduced.
- And much more...
