# 3.1.x

## 3.1.18

- Fix regression from `3.1.17` where resources may not have been freed correctly on shut down. This would only affect scripts that used `utils.LoadSVG`.

## 3.1.17

- The `SVG` renderer now supports `text`.

## 3.1.16

- Fix `JS Playlist` bug which prevented setting a custom group header height.
- Other minor bug fixes.

## 3.1.15

- Update `utils.LoadSVG` to use a better rendering library.

## 3.1.14

- Fix bugs with `IJSGraphics` `FillGradientRectangle` / `FillGradientRectangleAdvanced`.
- `on_library_items_changed` has a new `fromhook` argument. Will be `true` if changes comes from `Playback Statistics` or other components that utilise the same DB functionality.

## 3.1.13

- Fix `Thumbs` sample so existing images are not downloaded again.

## 3.1.12

- This is just a maintenance release with some bug fixes.

## 3.1.11

- The `Text Display` sample has been updated with simple scroll support. Existing users must re-import the script using the `Samples` button in the Configuration Window.
- Add utils.CreateTextLayout2. This allows the scrolling of styled text.
- Update utils.CreateTextLayout with `trimming_granularity` argument.

## 3.1.10

- Fix `Text Display` bug where the `$font` parsing code was broken if `$rgb` code was not also present.

## 3.1.9

- The `Text Display` sample has been updated to support custom `$font` title formatting. See this page for full details.

## 3.1.8

- Fix `utils.ReplaceIllegalChars` regression in `3.1.7`.

## 3.1.7

- If you use `Columns UI`, the component now requires the latest 2.0.0-alpha.5. Dialogs now respect the `Columns UI` `Dark Mode` settings and the `on_colours_changed` / `on_font_changed` callbacks also require it to function properly.
- fb.GetLibraryItems now accepts an optional `query` argument which utilises new `foobar2000` `2.0` code. Unlike `IMetadbHandleList GetQueryItems`, no errors are thrown and all items will be returned if the `query` is invalid.
- Various sample fixes.

## 3.1.6

- `plman.IsPlaylistLocked` and `plman.IsAutoPlaylist` have been updated so the supplied `playlistIndex` no longer has to be valid. This should fix `JS Playlist` and `Smooth Playlist Manager` from occasionally throwing errors when playlists are removed.

## 3.1.5

- Changing the Editor Properties is now done via a new `Style` button in the Configuration Window.

## 3.1.4

- Fix issue where `WebP` album art wasn't handled internally.

## 3.1.3

- Support for `WebP` images is now built in to the component. Using the `Windows Imaging Component (WIC)` was not reliable and may have caused display issues in recent changes to the `Spectrogram Seekbar` scripts.

## 3.1.2

- Update Text Display with album art background option. Existing users must re-import from the `Samples` button.

## 3.1.1

- on_metadb_changed has had the `fromhook` argument restored.
- Hopefully prevent `Smooth Browser` from updating itself when plays are recorded by `Playback Statistics`.

## 3.1.0

### Changes

- The minimum requirement for foobar2000 is now `2.0`.
- The `Editor Properties` in the main `Preferences` will be reset as the component now uses a brand new storage mechanism built in to foobar2000.
- window.IsDark has been updated to report `Default UI` `Dark Mode`.

### New additions

- `64bit` builds are now available.
- The `Preferences` and all popup dialogs have been updated to support `Dark Mode`. This depends on `Dark Mode` being enabled in the `Default UI` `Preferences` regardless of which user interface you use.
- The colours for the text edit area in the Configuration Window do not change dynamically. If using `Dark Mode`, try the new `Dark Grey` preset.
- The IMetadbHandle interface has a new `FileCreated` property. Unlike the new `%file_created%`, this is a timestamp.
- There is a new on_console_refresh callback and you can retrieve all `Console` messages using console.GetLines. Additionally, you can clear all messages with console.ClearBacklog.
- The on_main_menu callback last seen in the `2.x` series is back.
- Add utils.TextBox which provides a multi-line text edit area. Note that it always throws an error when cancelled so you must use `try/catch`.
- Add utils.Run.
- Add utils.RunCmdAsync and on_run_cmd_async_done.
- Add ITitleFormat EvalPlaylistItem. This is in addition to the ITitleFormat EvalActivePlaylistItem that existed previously.
- Various other improvements using new `SDK` features.

### Changes to clickable ratings (`JS Playlist`, `Smooth Playlist`)

> Note: These changes apply to the `3.1.x` series of components only. As of `foobar2000` `2.0 Beta 18`
> and component version `3.2.0`, detecting and using `foo_playcount` for `Playback Statistics`
> will be restored.

foobar2000 now has built in `Playback Statistics` which makes `foo_playcount` obsolete.
The clickable `RATING` stars in `JS Playlist` and `Smooth Playlist` previously relied on detection of that
component to determine whether to use `Playback Statistics` or write file tags but since that is no longer
possible, the following changes have been made:

- `JS Playlist` users must configure the title formatting in the `RATING` column to use `%rating%` for `Playback Statistics` or `$meta(rating)` for file tags. The script will detect which is in use when clicked. Note that the default is `%rating%`.
- `Smooth Playlist` users must choose which to use from the right click menu under `Track Info`.

### Sample changes

> Important note for current JS Playlist users: The `Cover` column and `Extra Rows` options have both been removed. `$rgb` title formatting should work
> again. It seems that it was broken during the transition to `3.0.0`.

> Note: Existing users of these samples must re-import using the `Samples` button. This is for bug fixes
> and new functionality.
> <ul>
> <li>Last.fm Artist Info + User Info (previously similar artists + charts)</li>
> <li>Text Display (This has had a major update to be more like the old <code>foo_textdisplay</code> component. It has full <code>$rgb</code> support and can display coloured emoji if using <code>Windows 10</code> or later.)</li>
> <li>Text Reader (Use this for displaying the contents of text files.)</li>
> <li>Spectrogram Seekbar</li>
> <li>Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons</li>
> <li>Track Info + Spectrogram Seekbar + Buttons</li>
> </ul>

- The `Spectrogram Seekbar` samples now save the cached images as `WebP` which are much smaller. For existing users, it will make a one time offer to delete any existing `PNG` files in your cache folder.
- `Smooth Browser` has some new add/send to playlist options:
- The `basic\GetColourScheme` sample for extracting the most dominant colours from an image has been updated with a `DetermineTextColour` function to calculate whether to write black or white text depending on the luminance of the background. The code for this was actually taken from the `foobar2000 SDK (C++)` and converted to `JavaScript`. Credit must to go Peter Pawlowksi who is the author of foobar2000.
- The same `DetermineTextColour` method used above has been used to improve the text colour used on selected items in the `JS Playlist` and `Smooth` samples.
- The `Properties` sample has been updated to display the new `%file_created%` field that is built in to foobar2000.
- The `Autoplaylists` sample has been removed.
