# Queue Viewer

Download

## Overview

This provides full playback queue management as an embedded UI element for `Default UI`
and `Columns UI`. There is also a standalone popup window available from the `View` menu.

There is full drag/drop support from other playlist / library viewer selections. You
can select single or multiple items to re-arrange or remove them entirely.

Unlike the original `foo_queuecontents` component, there is no support for multiple columns
but the `Item` column supports custom title formatting.

By right clicking on the column headers, you can set the title format pattern used
for the `Item` column, choose to `Keep queue on close` and sort the entire queue
by randomising or reverse.

## Usage

It is assumed you know how to add UI elements to your layout. Basic guides
can be found below.

Default UI

Columns UI

In addition to the drag/drop capabilities mentioned above, you can also right click any
playlist or library selection and use these new commands found under the `Queue Viewer` sub-menu:

```
Send to playback queue
Send to playback queue and play
Add to front of playback queue
Add to front of playback queue and play
```

The `Send` commands flush exisiting queue items first.

> Note: If menu items appear to be hidden, it's because the queue is limited to a maximum of 256
> tracks.

## Changes

### 1.0.26

- Compiled with latest `foobar2000` `SDK`.
- The minimum requirement is now `foobar2000` `2.1`.

### 1.0.25

- Fix bug where `foobar2000` keyboard shortcuts were suppressed if this panel had focus. This affected `Columns UI` only.

### 1.0.24

- Restore alternate line shading for `Default UI` elements.

### 1.0.23

- Improve UI colour handling.

### 1.0.22

- Code cleanup.

### 1.0.21

- Check dropped items and restored items against the active playlist to make `%queue_index%` available if possible.

### 1.0.20

- Viewer settings must now be set by right clicking the column header. Right clicking queue items only shows options relevant for the selection.

### 1.0.19

- Hopefully fix column header redraw glitch when toggling between dark and light modes in `Default UI`.

### 1.0.18

- Add random / reverse sort options to the viewer instance right click menu. They always apply to the whole queue, not the selection.

### 1.0.17

- Fix bug where the existing queue item count was not considered for displaying/hiding the new context menu options added in `1.0.16`.

### 1.0.16

- Add new context commands for adding playlist / library viewer selections to the front of the queue while keeping existing queue items.

### 1.0.15

- Make `%queue_index%` available when using the context menu `Send` options on `Library` selections that are also present in the active playlist.
- Remove auto-scroll workarounds and use the latest `foobar2000` `SDK` which fixes previously reported issues.

### 1.0.14

- Add support for themed style to match `Default UI` and `Columns UI` playlists.

### 1.0.13

- Implement auto-scrolling when drag/dropping over the top/bottom of the list.

### 1.0.12

- Improve UI colour handling.

### 1.0.11

- Fixes an issue where using the context menu to send active playlist items to the queue wasn't handled in the special way needed for the `%queue_index%` to be available.

### 1.0.10

- Adds context menu options for sending playlist/library viewer selections to the queue. As opposed to the existing add command, this flushes existing queue items first. There is also an option to play immediately.

### 1.0.9

- Fixes a bug where the column header font was not set correctly.

### 1.0.8

- You can now customise the title formatting used for the `Item` column. Use the option found on the right click menu.

### 1.0.7

- Fixes a bug where the selection state of moved items was not preserved.

### 1.0.6

- Add toggle for keeping the queue when `foobar2000` is closed. For this to work, a file named `foo_queue_viewer.fpl` is saved in the root of your `foobar2000` profile folder. It will be used to restore the queue on the next start. Note that this option is off by default.

### 1.0.5

- Fix bug when using the `Default UI` `System Default` theme in certain scenarios.

### 1.0.4

- Add support for drag/dropping playlist/library viewer selections on to the window.

### 1.0.3

- Add a popup window to the main `View` menu.

### 1.0.2

- Fix a bug in `1.0.1` which would cause a crash if the queue was active before adding a panel to a layout.
