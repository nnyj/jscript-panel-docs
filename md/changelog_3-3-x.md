# 3.3.x

## 3.3.40

- Adding utils.RemoveFolderRecursive in `3.3.35` accidentially broke `Windows 7` support so it has been temporarily removed in this release. But that makes this the last version compatible with `Windows 7`.

## 3.3.39

- This reverts the rendering rewrite in `3.3.30`. It has been buggy for a few users when used in tab stacks.

## 3.3.38

- Add date display to `Album` mode in `Smooth Browser`. It's not available with the `Overlayed text` style but is for all others.

## 3.3.37

- Fix `$jsp3_since` bug introduced in `3.3.36`.

## 3.3.36

- Minor improvement to the formatting of strings returned by `$jsp3_since` added in `3.3.35`.

## 3.3.35

- Add utils.RemoveFolderRecursive.
- Add `$jsp3_since` title format function. Supply it with a date string in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format and you'll get a return value like `44wk 2d`. If the difference is less than 24 hours, it will return `0d`.   This is not available globally, only in `JScript Panel 3`. For people not creating their own scripts, it can be used in `JS Playlist` custom columns or in `Text Display`.

## 3.3.34

- Add plman.GetPlaybackOrders.
- utils.LoadImage has been updated with an optional `max_size` option. The default is `0` which returns the original untouched. If the original image is smaller than a specified `max_size`, it will be returned untouched.
- `Thumbs` now defaults to a `max_size` of `1024px` for the main image but this can be changed via the right click menu options.

## 3.3.33

- Fix another `window.RepaintRect` bug introduced in `3.3.30`.

## 3.3.25

## 3.3.24
